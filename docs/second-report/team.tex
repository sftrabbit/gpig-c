\section{Team Structure}
\label{sec:team}

As in the initial report, we use the following acronyms for team members:

\begin{tabular}{ p{3cm} p{4cm} p{3.5cm} p{3.5cm} }
  \textbf{AJF}-Adam Fahie &
  \textbf{AIF}-Andrew Fairbairn &
  \textbf{TF}-Anthony Free &
  \textbf{TD}-Tom Davies \\
    \textbf{RT}-Rosy Tucker &
  \textbf{JM}-Joseph Mansfield &
  \textbf{MW}-Michael Walker \\
\end{tabular}

Before beginning this stage of the project, we recorded which university 
modules each team member was studying, in order to spread the work load evenly and reduce the identified risk of team members under-performing due to other commitments. We also assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, aiding in the selection of technologies and task assignment, as shown in table \ref{tab:skills}. Table \ref{tab:skills} shows that all team members are proficient with Java, and thus it was a natural choice of language for the prototype.

All team members contributed to the design of the HUMS architecture. 
However, when implementing the prototype, the team has been divided into three sub-teams, each assigned to different modules and requirements for the system. The sub-teams are organised such that team members with similar skills and  knowledge are placed together, encouraging low coupling and rapid development of individual modules, without worrying about the state of the overall system. The tasks assigned to each sub-team are shown below, reporting and notification engines were not assigned to any particular sub-team, meaning all team members were able to contribute to designs, 
encouraging creativity. The roles of each team member, revised from the Initial Report due to this new structure, are shown in table \ref{tab:roles}. A member of each sub-team has taken on a quality assurance and design role, ensuring a high quality of work from all team members.

\begin{description}
  \item[Team Sense (JM and MW)] Create Data Emitters for the test 
  applications, by producing reusable monitoring components and 
  implement the data input API as a multithreaded server, in order to 
  meet requirements regarding simultaneous usage.
    
  \item[Team Store (TD and RT)] Implement the database abstraction layer, and provide a concrete implementation using Google App Engine as a backing store, keeping the API generic in order to meet requirements regarding flexibility of database implementation.

  \item[Team Analyse (AJF, AIF, and TF)] Implement the analysis controller and 
  the analysis engine API. The engine API is to allow a large number of 
  different concrete implementations could be supplied.

\section{Development Plan}
\label{sec:developmentplan}

As a team, we considered the scope of the project being undertaken, and 
divided the work into specific tasks. Once tasks were identified, work was 
evenly divided amongst the sub-teams.
Before beginning development, the team updated and extended 
the previous Gantt chart based on customer feedback.
Figure \ref{fig:ganttInterim}  shows the plan for the interim phase of the project, starting with reviewing feedback from the previous report.
Figure \ref{fig:ganttFinal}  shows the plan for the final phase of the project, and more specifically identifies areas of the prototype to be refined.

Dependencies between tasks were examined allowing for a critical path 
through the project to be identified, showing the longest possible path through the project and the earliest point at which individual tasks can be started. This critical path analysis ensures that all work can be completed on time and that time is being used efficiently. 

Throughout development, we followed the agile methodology and test driven development approach set out in the Initial Report. We reviewed this and found that no changes to the plan were needed as the methodology suited our modular architecture, sub-teams, and iterative style.
