\section{Requirements Refinement}

\section{System Architecture}
\subsection{Quality Attributes}
Quality attributes are defined in order to ensure the architectural decisions made when 
creating the system architecture not only provide the required functionality,
but also produce a system meeting the expectations of all stakeholders. For example the 
system may be expected to meet certain security standards or availability levels. 
Explicitly defining these quality attributes before concretely designing a system allows for 
the correct tactics and patterns to be adopted in order to maximise the utility of important 
qualities.

When examining the HUMS non-functional requirements the following system quality 
attributes were identified:
	\begin{center}
	\textit{
		Availability, Performance, Modifiability, Security, Testability, Usability}
	\end{center}
Of these availability, performance, security and usability can be observed and measured, 
the others are unobservable 
however steps can still be taken to maximise their utility.
%Maybe go into more detail if space

Availability defines how ready the system is to be used, and is normally the percentage of 
downtime over a 
specified timeframe. The desired utility of the quality attribute within the HUMS, as 
defined by the non functional requirements, is  99.9\% per month. Since lack of 
availability is often linked to faults occurring, fault detection and recovery tactics, such as 
use of runtime exceptions, redundancy through backups and transactions, could be 
employed in order to achieve the desired level of availability. 

The performance of a system is normally measured by its latency and throughput. The 
HUMS is required to dispatch notifications through the notification generator after events 
have been triggered by the analysis controller with a latency less than 5ms, the system is 
also required to be able to support multiple data output clients, either notification or 
reporting. Tactics such as reducing overhead though carefully examining the time 
complexity of used data structures and prioritising events can help reduce latency, at 
least for the most important events, as defined by the end user. It may also be possible to 
add concurrency, such that multiple notification threads are used when demand for 
notifications and reports are high, reducing the bottleneck created at the notification 
generator.

Modifiability is one of the most important qualities of the HUMS, though not measurable, 
lack of modifiability can increase the cost and time taken to complete the project. The 
HUMS will initially be built to tackle a single domain, software, however will in the future 
be required to work on embedded systems, mechanical systems electrical systems and 
even people, in order to ensure this process is as efficient as possible the initial system 
must be modifiable.
Tactics that can be used to increase the modifiability of the system include using small 
modules within the system, decreasing the coupling between those modules and 
increasing the cohesion.

\section{Interim Prototype}

\section{Risk register}

A risk assessment has been performed as part of the initial report to ensure the
team is aware of any problems which could later arise, and to provide a guide as
to how to react when such problems occur. The hazards (risks) have been
identified and classified based upon team members' past experiences in similar
projects and group discussion. The areas these hazards impact were then
analysed, as well as the probability of occurrence. These are then weighted so
that we can identify the risks which are likely to have the greatest detrimental
effect on the project. The likelihood score (LS), impact score (IS) and risk matrix score 
(RS) are
listed in the table below.

\input{risk-register}

The likelihood score defines probability of something occurring. Utilising
\textit{Kents Words of Estimative Probability}\cite{kent1966strategic}, with
`certain' weighted $7$ and `impossible' weighted $1$.
