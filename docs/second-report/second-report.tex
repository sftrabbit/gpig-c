\section{Risk register}

A risk assessment has been performed as part of the initial report to ensure the
team is aware of any problems which could later arise, and to provide a guide as
to how to react when such problems occur. The hazards (risks) have been
identified and classified based upon team members' past experiences in similar
projects and group discussion. The areas these hazards impact were then
analysed, as well as the probability of occurrence. These are then weighted so
that we can identify the risks which are likely to have the greatest detrimental
effect on the project. The likelihood score (LS), impact score (IS) and risk matrix score (RS) are
listed in the table below.

\input{risk-register}

The likelihood score defines probability of something occurring. Utilising
\textit{Kents Words of Estimative Probability}\cite{kent1966strategic}, with
`certain' weighted $7$ and `impossible' weighted $1$.
