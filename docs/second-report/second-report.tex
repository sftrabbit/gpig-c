	\item[HUMS] Health and usage monitoring system(s).
	\item[Customer] Thales. 
	\item[Consumer] The recipient organisation of the system.
	\item[(End) User] An individual or organisation using the system.
	\item[Client] A piece of computer hardware or software which accesses a
	              service made available by the HUMS system.
	\item[The System] The HUMS we are designing and developing.
	\item[Event] A point of interest flagged up by an analysis system, which
	             may result in a notification.
	\item[Data input client] Anything that provides data to the HUMS through
	                         the input interface.
	\item[Data output client] Anything that receives data from the HUMS
	                          through the reporting or notification interfaces.
	\item[Notification] A message sent by the system as a result of an event
	                    being fired.
	\item[Report] A message sent by the system as a result of a request from a
	              user. 
	\item[HUMS Instance] One installation or occurrence of the system for a
	                     specific consumer.

\section{Requirements Refinement}

\section{System Architecture}
\subsection{Quality Attributes}
Quality attributes are defined in order to ensure the architectural decisions made when 
creating the system architecture not only provide the required functionality,
but also produce a system meeting the expectations of all stakeholders. For example the system may be expected to meet certain security standards or availability levels. Explicitly defining these quality attributes before concretely designing a system allows for the correct tactics and patterns to be adopted in order to maximise the utility of important qualities.

When examining the HUMS non-functional requirements the following quality attributes were identified:
	\begin{center}
	\textit{
		Availability, Performance, Maintainability, Security, Testability, Scalability, Usability}
	\end{center}
Of these availability, performance, security and usability can be observed and measured, the others are unobservable 
however steps can still be taken to maximise their utility.
%Maybe go into more detail if space

Availability defines how ready the system is to be used, and is normally defined as the percentage of downtime over a 
specified timeframe. The desired utility of the quality attribute within the HUMS, as defined by the non functional requirements, is  99.9\% per month. Tactics that could be employed in order to achieve this level of availability include fault detection, prevention and recovery tactics, since lack of availability is often linked to faults occurring.
When considering fault detection, exceptions can be used within the code, to detect when an runtime error has occurred, such as mis-formatted data and mitigate the situation without a fault occurring, this is however not comprehensive and susceptible to human error.

\section{Risk register}

A risk assessment has been performed as part of the initial report to ensure the
team is aware of any problems which could later arise, and to provide a guide as
to how to react when such problems occur. The hazards (risks) have been
identified and classified based upon team members' past experiences in similar
projects and group discussion. The areas these hazards impact were then
analysed, as well as the probability of occurrence. These are then weighted so
that we can identify the risks which are likely to have the greatest detrimental
effect on the project. The likelihood score (LS), impact score (IS) and risk matrix score (RS) are
listed in the table below.

\input{risk-register}

The likelihood score defines probability of something occurring. Utilising
\textit{Kents Words of Estimative Probability}\cite{kent1966strategic}, with
`certain' weighted $7$ and `impossible' weighted $1$.
