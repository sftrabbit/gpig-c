\section{Customer communication}
\label{sec:communication}

Our initial communication with the customer for this stage of the project was in the form of a face to face meeting where we received feedback on our previous report. This feedback was recorded and acted upon, including extending the risk register to include more technical risks and examining the qualities of the system. Our next contact was through email in which we sent a low fidelity prototype of the HUMS admin centre, explaining our idea of hosting a HUMS as a SaaS or PaaS, to which the customer replied the idea was interesting and suggested some small improvements. 

After each communication with the customer we organised group meetings within two days to discuss the feedback issued and to collaborate on any improvements to our solution we could make based upon the feedback. In our next face to face meeting with the customer we explained our architectural ideas and discussed the test application, we then went on to have a team meeting where we planned how to monitor the test application. We then sent the customer a series of emails detailing implementation and architectural decisions, including the qualities and views we identified, and also an example of a reporting engine. The customer replied with helpful feedback including additional qualities they felt were important to the system and positive feedback on the module view diagram.
