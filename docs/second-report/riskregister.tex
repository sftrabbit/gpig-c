\section{Risk register}
\label{sec:riskregister}

A risk assessment has been performed, based on the design decisions made throughout the initial and interim phases of the project, ensuring team members are aware how to react to problems when they occur. After feedback from the customer we took extra time to ensure both technical and procedural risks were identified early on. The risks from the Initial Report were reviewed and updated to reflect the more technical aspects of implementation. Risks relating to specific components were added, and some existing team planning risks were merged.

The hazards (risks) have been identified by examining the 
current literature \cite{boehm1991software,jones1998minimizing}, drawing upon team members' past experiences and group discussion. Classification of the identified hazards, their impact on the system and their probability of occurrence is performed in accordance with the Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems \cite{stoneburner2002risk}. The areas these hazards impact were then analysed, as well as the probability of occurrence. These are then weighted so that we can identify the risks which are likely to have the greatest detrimental effect on the project. The likelihood score (LS), impact score (IS) and risk matrix score (RS) are listed in the table below.

The likelihood score defines probability of something occurring. Utilising
\textit{Kents Words of Estimative Probability}\cite{kent1966strategic}, with
`certain' weighted $7$ and `impossible' weighted $1$.
