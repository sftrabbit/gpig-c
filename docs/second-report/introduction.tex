\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This report details the design and development of a HUMS, particularly any progress made since the Initial Report. Section~\ref{sec:requirements} refines previously identified requirements of the HUMS, leading to section~\ref{sec:architecture} which identifies associated quality attributes. A detailed insight into the underlying system architecture at multiple levels of abstraction is provided in section~\ref{sec:architecture}. Based on this design, a prototype solution has been developed and an evaluation of technical progress is given in section~\ref{sec:prototype}. Section~\ref{sec:team} gives an overview of team structure, including allocation of tasks. A plan for further development is given in section~\ref{sec:developmentplan}, and a thorough risk assessment is presented in section~\ref{sec:riskregister}. Lastly, a summary of communication with the Customer is given in section~\ref{sec:communication}.
