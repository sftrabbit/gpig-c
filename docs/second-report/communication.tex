\section{Customer communication}
\label{sec:communication}

As we are, and were, aware that the customer may not be able to respond to communications rapidly. We have taken a proactive approach to communications. For each response from the customer, we organised group meetings within two days to discuss the feedback issued and to collaborate on any improvements to our solution we could make based upon the customer communication. We have previously highlighted in the document, in the relevant section, some of the feedback which we have taken on board from the previous assessment feedback. So this section is dedicated to communication in the form of emails since the previous assessment.

The feedback from the customer (?/? Date ??) suggested that our concept of SaaS and PaaS is interesting, and as such we have developed this idea to include the application to various usage scenarios. Furthermore, the feedback was that the website we presented in this communication did not sufficiently explain what the HUMS concept was to the potential consumers accessing our HUMS SaaS website. Therefore, we have added a section explaining how the HUMS system works and how it can be conveniently applied to various applications which are relevant to the consumer.
