\section{Risk register}
\label{sec:riskregister}

A risk assessment has been performed as part of the \hl{initial}
report to ensure the team is aware of any problems which could later
arise, and to provide a guide as to how to react when such problems
occur. The hazards (risks) have been identified and classified based
upon team members' past experiences in similar projects and group
discussion. The areas these hazards impact were then analysed, as well
as the probability of occurrence. These are then weighted so that we
can identify the risks which are likely to have the greatest
detrimental effect on the project. The likelihood score (LS), impact
score (IS) and risk matrix score (RS) are listed in the table below.

  \hline \textbf{R.1}
  & Short term loss of team members
  & 6
  & 3
  & Deadline failure
  & Ensurance that no work relating to the project is outside of team
  version control. Use of scrum methodology proactively aids work
  reallocation, ensuring team members are aware of all assigned work.
  & Reallocation of work across remaining team members
  & 18 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.2}
  & Long term loss of team members
  & 2
  & 5
  & Deadline failure and low standard of deliverables
  & Mitigation measures mentioned in R.1. to reduce impact of this
  scenario.
  & Notification of customer, possible deadline extension.
  & 10 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.3}
  & Short or long term loss of resources
  & 2
  & 5
  & Deadline failure and loss of code base
  & Use of version control. Code-base and history is decentralised.
  & If remote repository (GitHub) is lost, local checkouts/university
  backups can be used to regain access to resources.
  & 10 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.4}
  & Team member under-performance
  & 4
  & 4
  & Deadline failure and low standard of deliverables
  & Establish skills of team as a whole early on. Establish skills of
  individual members early on and taken into account when assigning
  roles.
  & Re-allocation of roles to better suit member strengths.
  & 16 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.5}
  & Misinterpreta\-tion of requirements
  & 3
  & 4
  & Deliverables that are not valid
  & Proactively define requirements, design and implementation
  strategy with the customer. Iterative process stopping when both
  customer and developers are content.
  & Changes to requirements must result in re-negotiated deadlines.
  & 12 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.6}
  & Slow response to customer queries
  & 3
  & 5
  & Deadline failure and low standard of deliverables
  & Communication of issues well in advance of any deadlines.
  & Depending on time available to deadline, contingency is either to
  wait - or to implement best solution as decided by the team without
  receiving customer communication.
  & 15 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.7}
  & Failure to produce required system functionality
  & 2
  & 5
  & Wasted time and loss of marks
  & Verification of requirements by customer. Testing of system, to
  ensure all agreed upon requirements are met.
  &
  & 10 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.8}
  & Missing internal team deadlines
  & 5
  & 3
  & Project falls behind due to missing dependencies
  & Perform critical path analysis to identify tasks that take the
  longest amount of time and tasks that are prerequisites to
  others. Assign greater team effort to these areas if it seems likely
  to result in a deadline miss, or halt in progress elsewhere in the
  project.
  & Greater team effort on area of deadline miss, to accelerate its
  completion.
  & 15 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.9}
  & System performance required unattainable
  & 2
  & 4
  & Could cause a task backlog: gradual increase in load until system
  is inoperational
  & Choice of implementation or choice of utilised hardware must offer
  enough in the way of performance to facilitate acceptable system
  performance.
  & All of, or combination of: optimisation of code, sse of faster
  hardware, use of faster networks
  & 8 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.10}
  & Design incomplete
  & 2
  & 5
  & Deadline failure and/or low standard of deliverables and/or late
  submission
  & Critical path analysis of roles. Allocation of roles to areas of
  strength for each team member where possible. 
  &
  & 10 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.11}
  & Design unfeasible
  & 2
  & 5
  & Deadline failure and/or low standard of deliverables
  & Careful consideration of each aspect of the system design prior to
  commencement of work. Design to be agreed by the team as a whole,
  with any areas of issues addressed. Identify areas of worry before
  commencement of work, and put mitigation in place or choose an
  alternative solution.
  & Abandonment of work completed thus far. Restart required.
  & 10 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.12}
  & Database implementation choice does not give required performance
  & 3
  & 3
  & Database queries fail or take too long
  & Careful selection and comparison of database technologies.
  & Perform new comparison of database technologies, utilise new
  database technology of possible. Implementation of query
  optimisations and/or database optimisations if appropriate.
  & 9 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.13}
  & System verification failure
  & 2
  & 5
  & Low standard of deliverables
  & Test system with unit tests throughout to ensure verification of
  requirements.
  & Re-implementation of affected parts of the system.
  & 10 \\

  \hline \textbf{R.14}
  & System validation failure
  & 2
  & 5

  starts on the system.
  & Re-implementation of affected parts of the system.

The likelihood score defines probability of something occurring. Utilising
\textit{Kents Words of Estimative Probability}\cite{kent1966strategic}, with
`certain' weighted $7$ and `impossible' weighted $1$.
