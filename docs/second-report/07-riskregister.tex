\section{Risk register}
\label{sec:riskregister}

A risk assessment has been performed as part of the interim
report to ensure the team is aware of any problems which could later
arise, and to provide a guide as to how to react when such problems
occur. The hazards (risks) have been identified by examining the 
current literature \cite{boehm1991software,jones1998minimizing}, drawing upon team members' past experiences and group 
discussion. Classification of the identified hazards, their impact on the system and their probability of occurrence is performed 
in accordance with the Risk Management Guide for Information Technology 
Systems \cite{stoneburner2002risk}. The areas these hazards impact were then analysed, as 
well as the probability of occurrence. These are then weighted so 
that we can identify the risks which are likely to 
have the greatest detrimental effect on the project. The likelihood 
score (LS), impact score (IS) and risk matrix score (RS) are listed 
in the table below.

  & Ensure that no work relating to the project is outside of team
  version control. Use of scrum methodology proactively aids work
  reallocation, ensuring team members are aware of all assigned work.

  & \\
  
  \hline \textbf{R.}
  & Deprecation of required Google App Engine functionality
  &

  & \\
  
  \hline \textbf{R.}
  & System performance required unattainable
  & 2
  & 4
  & Could cause a task backlog: gradual increase in load until system
  is non-operational
  & Choice of implementation or choice of utilised hardware must offer
  enough in the way of performance to facilitate acceptable system
  performance.
  & All of, or combination of: optimisation of code, use of faster
  hardware, use of faster networks

The likelihood score defines probability of something occurring. Utilising
\textit{Kents Words of Estimative Probability}\cite{kent1966strategic}, with
`certain' weighted $7$ and `impossible' weighted $1$.
