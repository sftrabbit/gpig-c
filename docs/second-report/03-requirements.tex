\section{Requirements Refinement}
\label{sec:requirements}
After feedback from the initial report the original requirements have been altered and, where possible, refined.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements-functional}
Below the existing functional requirements are refined, based on customer feedback and the design designs made in the previous report.

\frit{1} is refined to specify how data emitters will send data to the system, and the type of data required. 
\frit{2} required data to be timestamped, but didn't specify how these timestamps were to be produced, \frit{2.1} and \frit{2.2} assign this
responsibility to the data emitter and consumer system, and mandate when timestamps should be created.

\frit{3} is refined by specifying how the data is to be stored, allowing the end user to choose the technology of their choice, meaning the database can be changed without needing to alter other HUMs modules, making it easy to move the HUMS across domains.
\frit{4} was modified such that the previous requirements \frit{4}, \frit{6}, \frit{9}, and \frit{10} can all be expressed as refinements, with the configuration file containing all end user settings. The new \frit{5} and \frit{6} enforce the  functionality that the HUMS must provide as a result of the data in the configuration file.

\frit{7}, previously \frit{12}, is refined to define how data will be analysed for events. It is identified that there must be an API allowing analysis engines, either created by the consumer or included with the HUMS, to extract stored data and produce events. 

\frit{9} to \frit{13} do not appear in the previous report, and were discovered to be necessary following feedback from the customer regarding the ability of the system to allow the output of analysis to effect the monitored system. It was felt that our architecture did not make it clear whether this was possible or not, therefore these requirements were added as clarification.

		 \item[\fr{4.5}] The HUMS shall allow the user to de- fine that, upon 			reaching their defined data storage limit, old data is deleted to make 			room for new data.
	\end{description}
	%%FR5
	 \item[\fr{5}] The HUMS shall send a notification when the consumers 		defined low storage threshold is reached.
	  \item[\fr{6}] The HUMS must store no more data records than the 			consumers defined storage quota.
	\item[\fr{7}]Events shall be triggered in response to new data that 			matches a pattern that the consumer has specified.
	  \begin{description}
	  
		 \item[\fr{7.1}]  The HUMS shall allow the consumer to specify what 		 	patterns of data will produce events.
		  
		 \item[\fr{7.2}] The HUMS shall allow the user to define their
 		own events.
		
 		\item[\fr{7.3}] The HUMS shall provide an analysis API, allowing 			analysis engines to extract and analyse data.

 		\item[\fr{7.5}] The HUMS shall provide a simple analysis engine
 		in the form of a rules engine.
	\end{description}
	
	\item[\fr{8}]After the sending of a notification for an event of a particular 		type, no more notifications for an event of that type will be sent 				during the cool down period.
	\item[\fr{9}]The system shall dispatch an event to a notification generator 		when a specified data pattern in detected.
	\item[\fr{7}] The HUMS must interface with reports engines, allowing 			them to pull reports.

	\item[\fr{12}] The system shall allow for notifications to change the way in 		which data is sensed.
	 \item[\fr{13}] The system shall allow notifications to be sent back to the 		system being monitored.
\end{description}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Non-function requirements remain remain the same, however, \nfrit{14} has been added in order to clarify that data can be sent and stored in any format, enforcing that the consumers system will not have to conform to the HUMS. It is also recognised that \nfrit{5}, \nfrit{9} and \nfrit{11} are requirements specific to the prototype, as functional requirements require the datastore to be changeable meaning, in the general case, requirements about the abilities of the datastore are not verifiable.
\begin{description}
\item[\nfr{1}] The HUMS shall be able to receive hardware changes without loss of previously stored data.
\item[\nfr{2}]  Users shall be provided with documentation detailing how to use the system.
\item[\nfr{3}] When running externally on servers, the system must be accessible to end users in multiple
geographic locations.
\item[\nfr{4}]  The system shall only accept data from an input client providing valid credentials. 
\item[\nfr{5}] The system shall store data according to the relevant industry security standards. 
\item[\nfr{6}]  The system shall be tested to ensure all requirements are met before deployment.
\item[\nfr{7}] The customer will complete acceptance testing before the system is deployed.
\item[\nfr{8}] The system must be able to support at least 5 output clients per HUMS instance. 
\item[\nfr{9}]  The system must cope with up to 2000 data input requests per second per HUMS instance. 
\item[\nfr{10}] The system must be available for no less than 99.9\% of each month.
\item[\nfr{11}]  Data must be backed up within 24 hours of having been made available to the system.
 \item[\nfr{12}] Timestamps applied by the system must be accurate to within 5ms of UTC.
\item[\nfr{13}]  The system shall dispatch notifications within 5ms of the event being triggered.
\item[\nfr{14}] The system shall support storing data without requiring specific schemata.
