\section{Introduction} %40 words
This document is intended for both ourselves and the customer. It contains
an initial analysis of requirements and a development plan. A proposed solution,
based on identified use cases and requirements, is presented herein.
 
\subsection{Single statement of need} %40 words
We aim to deliver a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS), tailorable to
multiple target domains. The target user for the system is any consumer needing
to collect, store, analyse and report data from one or more data input clients.

\end{description}

\section{Requirements}

For this project, requirements have been divided into three categories:
functional, non-functional and constraint. The requirements have been
engineered such that each falls into one of these three categories, which
prevents them from becoming too complex. Each requirement has been
structured as simply and concisely as possible and been worded in such a way
as to avoid ambiguity. The requirements represent the problem to be solved
and serve as a contract between us, as the development team, and the
customer. All requirements have therefore been checked with the customer to
ensure the system described is the system they envisioned.

The functional requirements detail what inputs, behaviour and outputs the system
must provide. The non-functional requirements specify the qualities of the
system as opposed to its behaviour. Constraint requirements are those that apply
to the entire system, including any constraints on the environment the system
can be used in and any timing constraints. In order to ensure all requirements
are verifiable, appropriate testing procedures have been included.

\section{Possible solutions}

When examining possible HUMS solutions, we inspected sensing, storing, analysing
and reporting data separately. This was done so that the best choice for each
could be individually selected, ensuring every sector of the system performs to
the highest possible standard.

When examining how the HUMS should sense new data we identified three distinct
options:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data input clients are directly linked to the system, with data being
	      pushed or polled depending on client support. This requires the system
	      to implement custom data specifications, which is likely to become
	      infeasible as the system expands across domains.
	\item Unmanaged data input clients which store data elsewhere. The HUMS polls
	      for data at the customers request. This option is more
	      inefficient than having data pushed to the system since polls may
	      frequently fail to collect data and therefore waste resources, or data
	      may otherwise be available but uncollected by the HUMS and thereby
	      leave it out-of-date. This approach, however, may integrate better with 
	      existing data input clients, reducing workload for the consumer.
	\item Provide an input API which data input clients wishing to push data to
	      the system must implement. This option is the most flexible, allowing
	      the system to be integrated with any consumer system, in any domain. It
	      does potentially mean more work for the consumer in migrating existing
	      systems to use the provided API. 
\end{enumerate} 
When considering options for how to store data there are two core methods, an
SQL or NoSQL database. Using an SQL database would provide the consumer with
guaranteed atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID), thereby
offering reliability over throughput. Migration for the consumer may be easier
when using an SQL database, as SQL has been popular among enterprises for a long
time. However, SQL does not easily scale horizontally, making it difficult to
expand one system across a large number of consumers. NoSQL solves the problem
of scalability at the expense of full ACID compliance. Polyglot persistence offers a
solution to all of the problems identified when choosing between SQL and NoSQL,
by allowing the use of both. When using polyglot persistence the type and
structure of every type of data must be examined to determine which datastore is
most suitable, whether SQL or NoSQL.

When designing the data analysis segment of the system there are three feasible
implementations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A plugin API, which allows users to implement their own analysis rules.
	      The system would provide multiple layers of abstraction, allowing the
	      consumer to take control of analysis at the level they see fit. For
	      example, using a low level API may be faster and allow greater
	      customisation, but a web API is more generic and easier for the consumer
	      to implement.
	\item Providing a rules engine for analysis, allowing the consumer to specify
	      and integrate their analysis requirements at a high level. This option
	      would be useful from the consumers perspective, abstracting from any low
	      level interfacing with the HUMS, but increasing the workload for our
	      team.
	\item Create customised single-purpose tools for each domain. This would be
	      massively inefficient from a development perspective, as well as costly
	      and inflexible. However the consumer may prefer to have a system
	      completely designed around their needs. 
\end{enumerate}
For the reporting segment of the HUMS there are again multiple options.
Consumers may wish to pull reports from the system at specified times, or want
the system to notify another system or end user when an event has occurred. When
considering the consumer requesting a data report, we could provide them with a
single output format such as PDF or XML, however this is not very flexible and
is unlikely to provide the required functionality for all consumers. Another
option is to allow the user to directly access the HUMS datastore, however this
would leave the system open to data inconsistencies and expose implementation
details to the consumer. A more flexible solution would be to provide a generic
reporting API to which plugins can be added. Each plugin would add a different
report format, allowing the consumer to choose which they wish to use in each
situation. This solution would be highly flexible, with new plugins being added
as the HUMS extends across domains.

When pushing notifications to another system or user, the HUMS could send events
encoded with a standard data interchange format, for example JSON or XML. This
would allow them to process the output themselves. The HUMS could also provide a
set of plugins allowing the consumer to choose what type of notification is
triggered when an event of a specific type occurs. For example, the system could
send an email for passive events but a mobile push notification or text message
for an event that requires urgent action. Allowing a variety of notification
channels provides a much more tailorable and maintainable product, but it
requires more development time and effort.

\subsection{Proposed solution}
Our proposed solution, shown in figure \ref{fig:systemDiagram}, uses the 
concept of a client-server architecture, with the consumer's system acting 
as the client and the server being the HUMS processing the data. 
The HUMS could exist within the consumer's data input client, or could be 
geographically-distant but connected on the same network or though the 
internet. The solution brings together the best elements from our
possible solutions for each section of the system, utilising a plugin
architecture for several components. 

The HUMS will provide an input API for data input clients to push new data to the
system, accepting any correctly formatted sensor data sent on the correct
network $(\textbf{DD.1})$. Achieving correctly formatted data may require changes
to the consumer's system, or use of middleware. This approach makes our system
flexible, supporting a wide range of data input clients, meaning in future the
solution could easily extend across domains. 

For data storage, the only applicable solution in this scenario is a database
$(\textbf{DD.2}).$ Using polyglot persistence gives us the option of choosing the
database technology most suited to the data, which we will determine
during development. To make our choice we will look at all the relevant
technologies available and evaluate strengths and weaknesses in relation to
other design decisions for the data being stored, and how it will be accessed. 

For analysis the system will provide generic plugins, as well as an API for
consumers to extend and create their own specialised analysis rules
 $(\textbf{DD.4})$. Offering an API allows the system to be tailored to different 
 consumers and domains, as generic analysis tools
could not hope to meet every consumer's needs by itself.  Domain-specific plugins 
will be provided to simplify the process for those performing common analysis
 functions. This might include graphical tools or other user-friendly features. 
 The range of plugins offered can be expanded as the system expands into 
 more domains. 

We will allow the consumer to customise the types of reports that can be 
created $(\textbf{DD.5})$. They will be able to request reports in a variety of 
formats, including human-friendly formats, such as PDF, and common data interchange
 formats, such as XML. Consumers can use these data formats as a data API to build their own
reports or for any other purpose. This will allow the consumer flexibility to produce 
what they want, whilst also offering them easy to use built-in tools.

Our system will provide plugins to support various types of notifications 
$(\textbf{DD.6})$ that can be triggered based upon customisable events. 
Notifications will include emails and mobile push, alongside more generic notifications formatted 
in standard formats such as XML. The generic notifications 
could then be processed further by the consumer, allowing them to tailor how 
notifications are used and delivered. 

An administration centre $(\textbf{DD.3})$ that allows
the consumer to configure any customisable system settings, including setting up
events that trigger notifications and defining data schemas, will also be included. This tool 
will be offered through an intuitive web based interface which is only accessible by the
authorised consumer. 

For the prototype we hope to demonstrate at the end of the project, we plan to
implement most of the solution described above. The core of the system,
including sensing, storing, analysing and reporting data, will be functional,
as will a small set of the domain specific components built utilising the plugin 
architecture. Some additional simple components may be required when 
demonstrating, such as a tool to simulate data being input to the system.

\section{Team organisation}

\subsection{Team members}
A list of team members is provided below, accompanied by a list of roles and
assignments relevant for the course of the project. The responsibilities have
been divided in a such a way that effort for all team members is equal and
fairly distributed. Assignees have been given roles which, where possible,
utilise their identified skills, and minimise exposure to established
weaknesses.

\section{Development plan}

\subsection{Software engineering methodology}
When developing the HUMS system, we chose to take an agile approach to
development and team management. Our implementation will follow a plugin
architecture, with one central codebase providing the core functionality and
plugins which provide domain tailorability. If a non-agile approach was to be
taken, a plugin architecture would be infeasible as those methodologies require
all requirements and documentation to be completed before development commences.
For example, the V-model and Waterfall model are linear processes, where
requirements are only discussed and designed before implementation commences.
This linearity gives no support for changes in requirements during the later
phases. Given the time constraints and the need for the system to be able to
evolve into various domains, these linear development methodologies are
impractical.

Agile software development, however, allows the project to split into smaller
sub-projects called `iterations' \cite{hazzan2008agile}. Each iteration allows
for a different section of the project to be planned, documented, developed and
tested. It also allows for the development team to be split into smaller
sub-teams working simultaneously on different areas on the project. At the end
of each iteration project priorities can be re-evaluated and the team structure
altered. 

\cite{hazzan2008agile} identifies three key perspectives of software
development: human, organisational and technological. The scrum methodology
harnesses two of those perspectives, providing a platform for both team and
project organisation. Unfortunately scrum does not provide a clear approach to
development from a technological perspective, providing no clear guidelines on
how code should be created or structured. However, the test driven approach does
provide a clear method of developing software from a technological perspective.
This encourages the development of unit and acceptance tests before the
development of code, the code itself is then written to make the tests pass.
Using both methodologies side by side appears to be the best approach for this
project, allowing for a well managed and organised team to produce well
structured and reliable code. Feature driven development could be used in place
of test driven and would provide a good platform for plugin generation, allowing
each plugin to be designed and implemented independently. However, it conflicts
with the project organisation aspects of the scrum methodology, meaning they
could not be used together without creating confusion. Since the scrum method
provides more guidance for managing team structure and monitoring project
progress, feature driven development was discounted in favour of scrum.

\subsection{Schedule}
After examining the scope of the project we divided the first two phases into a schedule of tasks, with each task assigned to the team members responsible for the corresponding project role. We then organised the tasks into sprints, assigning work periods for each. Once organised the tasks were examined to ensure equal effort from all team members throughout the course of the project. Dependencies between tasks were then extracted, identifying a critical path through the project, ensuring, for every task, all prerequisite tasks are completed prior to the task commencing.  The flow of work can be seen in figure \ref{fig:Gantt} and shows an even work schedule throughout.

\end{figure}


\section{Risk register}

A risk assessment has been performed as part of the initial report to ensure the
team is aware of any problems which could later arise, and to provide a guide as
to how to react when such problems occur. The hazards (risks) have been
identified and classified based upon team members' past experiences in similar
projects and group discussion. The areas these hazards impact were then
analysed, as well as the probability of occurrence. These are then weighted so
that we can identify the risks which are likely to have the greatest detrimental
effect on the project. The likelihood score (LS) and impact scores (IS) are
listed in the table below.

\input{risk-register}

The likelihood score defines probability of something occurring. Utilising
\textit{Kents Words of Estimative Probability}\cite{kent1966strategic}, with
`certain' weighted $7$ and `impossible' weighted $1$.

\input{risklevel-table}

\section{Customer communication}

Knowing that the customer may not respond to emails rapidly, we began our
correspondence promptly after the project kick off. The customer did
respond quickly to all messages, however we feel that erring on the side of
caution and starting early was the best strategy. We followed up each response
with a team meeting within two days in order to discuss and implement any
changes or suggestions mentioned.

Communication so far has focussed on verifying that the outlined requirements
meet the expectations of the customer. We used the initial meeting $(9/10)$ to
clarify terminology and produce an initial set of requirements,  having
formatted these we sent them to the customer for feedback $(13/10)$.

Feedback $(14/10)$ suggested that our understanding of system tailorability was
inaccurate, with the customer providing clarification. After altering the
requirements in response and resending them to the customer $(16/10)$, we received
further feedback suggesting that the wording of our requirements was lacking in
parts.

We quickly remedied this before forwarding the changes to the customer $(19/10)$,
which resulted in helpful feedback allowing us to settle on the outlined list
of requirements. In producing and gradually refining the requirements, we began
to conceive an idea of how the system should function, and how it should be
tailorable. This has directly affected our proposed solution, by leading us
towards the outlined client-server architecture, where the HUMS acts as the
server. Having decided that we wanted to structure the HUMS as a framework with
support for plugins, we pitched this idea to the customer and received positive
and succinct feedback.
