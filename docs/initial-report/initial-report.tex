\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Single statement of need}
This project aims to deliver a tailorable Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS), tailorable to multiple target domains. The target for the system is any consumer needing to collect, store, analyse and report data from one or more data input clients.
\subsection{Intended audience of this document}
The intended audience of this document are both the developers and the customer. The document is structured in a manner which will interest all concerned parties. Requirements will follow the introduction, followed by use cases, a review of possible solutions and a risk register.

\section{Use cases}
\noindent \textbf{ID:} UC1\\
\textbf{Name:} Monitoring a system.\\
\textbf{Context:} The organisation has developed a system, for which they require health and usage monitoring.\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:} The organisation's technical representative.\\
\textbf{Secondary Actors:} The health and usage monitoring system, the organisation's system.\\
\textbf{Precondition:}  The organisation has a system that requires monitoring. The organisation's system and environment must conform to the constraint requirements detailed in this document.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Exception Postcondition:} If the end user's system could not be integrated with the HUMS, the user is provided with diagnostic information and technical support needed to solve any problems. If the end user chose to quit the process, they are presented with access to technical support.\\\\
\noindent \textbf{ID:} UC2\\
\textbf{Name:} Analysing collected data.\\

\section{Requirements}
For this project, requirements have been divided into three categories, functional, non-functional and constraint. The requirements have been engineered such that each falls into one of those three categories, this prevents them from becoming too complex. Each requirement has been structured as simply and concisely as possible and been worded in such a way as to avoid ambiguity. The requirements represent the problem to be solved and serve as a contract between us, as the development team, and the customer. All requirements have therefore been checked with the customer to ensure the system described is the system they envisioned.\\
The functional requirements detail what inputs, behaviour and outputs the system must provide. The non-functional requirements specify the qualities of the system as opposed to its behaviour. Constraint requirements are those that apply to the entire system, including any constraints on the environment the system can be used in and any timing constraints. In order to ensure all requirements are verifiable, appropriate testing procedures have been included.

\section{Possible solutions}

\subsection{Proposed solution}
Our proposed solution uses the concept of a client-server architecture, where the client is the consumer?s system, sensing the data, and the server is the system processing the data. These could exist within the same package or on the same device, but they could also be geographically-distant machines connected across the internet. The solution brings together the best elements from our possible solutions for each section of the system, utilising a plugin architecture for several components.
\\ \\
We will provide an input API for data input clients to push new data to the system, accepting any correctly formatted sensor data sent on the correct network (DD.1). Achieving correctly formatted data may require changes to the consumers system, or using middleware. This approach makes our system flexible, supporting a wide range of data input clients, meaning in future the solution could easily extend across domains.
\\ \\
For data storage, the only applicable solution in this scenario is a database (DD.2). Using polyglot persistence gives us the option of choosing a database technology most suited to the consumer?s needs, which we will determine during development. To make our choice we will look at all the relevant technologies available and evaluate strengths and weaknesses in relation to other design decisions for the data being stored, and how it will be accessed.
\\ \\
The data analysis part of the system will provide plugins offering analysis tools, as well as an API for consumers to extend and create their own specialised analysis rules (DD.4). Offering an API makes the system more tailorable to different consumers and domains, as generic analysis tools could not hope to meet every consumers needs by itself. Since some customers may not want to take on the task of creating a whole analysis system themselves, we will offer domain-specific plugins to simplify the process. This might include graphical tools or other user-friendly features. The range of plugins offered can be expanded as the system expands into more domains.
\\ \\
The system will include various output features for generating reports (DD.5) and providing notifications (DD.6). For reports, we will allow the consumer to customise the types of reports created. They will be able to request reports in a variety of formats, including human-friendly formats, e.g. PDF, and common data interchange formats. Consumers can use these data formats as a data API to build their own reports or for any other purpose. This will allow the consumer flexibility to produce what they want, whilst also offering them easy to use built-in tools.
\\ \\
Our system will provide plugins to support various types of notification that can be triggered based upon customisable events. Notifications will include  emails, alongside more generic notifications formatted in standard formats such as XML, just as with reports. The generic notifications could then be processed further by the consumer, allowing them to tailor how notifications are used and delivered.
\\ \\
The system will also provide an administration centre (DD.3) that lets the consumer configure any customisable system settings including, setting up events that trigger notifications and defining data schemas. This tool will be offered through an intuitive web based interface which is only accessible by the authorised consumer.
\\ \\
For the prototype we hope to demonstrate at the end of the project, we plan to implement most of the solution described above. The core of the system, including sensing, storing, analysing and reporting data, will be functional, as will some of the basic components built utilising the plugin architecture. Some additional simple components may be required when demonstrating, such as a tool to simulate data being input to the system.

\subsection{Time and Task Management}

\section{Development plan}

\subsection{Software engineering methodology}
When developing the HUMS system, we chose to take an agile approach to development and team management. Our implementation will follow a plugin architecture, with one central codebase providing the core functionality and plugins which provide domain tailorability. If a non-agile approach was to be taken, a plugin architecture would be infeasible as those methodologies require all requirements and documentation to be completed before development commences. For example, the V-Model and waterfall model are linear processes, where requirements are only discussed and designed before implementation commences. This linearity gives no support for changes in requirements during the later phases. Given the time constraints and the need for the system to be able to evolve into various domains, these linear development methodologies are impractical. \\
Agile software development, however, allows the project to split into smaller subprojects called `iterations' \cite{hazzan2008agile}. Each iteration allows for a different section of the project to be planned, documented, developed and tested. It also allows for the development team to be split into smaller sub-teams working simultaneously on different areas on the project. At the end of each iteration project priorities can be re-evaluated and the team structure altered. 
\cite{hazzan2008agile} identifies three key perspectives of software development: human, organisational and technological. The scrum methodology harnesses two of those perspectives, providing a platform for both team and project organisation. Unfortunately scrum does not provide a clear approach to development from a technological perspective, providing no clear guidelines on how code should be created or structured. However, the test driven approach does provide a clear method of developing software from a technological perspective. This encourages the development of unit and acceptance tests before the development of code, the code itself is then written to make the tests pass. Using both methodologies side by side appears to be the best approach for this project, allowing for a well managed and organised team to produce well structured and reliable code. Feature driven development could be used in place of test driven and would provide a good platform for plugin generation, allowing each plugin to be designed and implemented independently. However, it conflicts with the project organisation aspects of the scrum methodology, meaning they could not be used together without creating confusion. Since the scrum method provides more guidance for managing team structure and monitoring project progress, feature driven development was discounted in favour of scrum.
