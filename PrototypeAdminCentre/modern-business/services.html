          <p>Sense whatever data you want, from wherever you want, 24/7. With a vast array of pre-made sensing plugins for monitoring system processes, hardware in the field, or networked services, GPIC-G can bootstrap your monitoring network within minutes.</p>
          <p>There's no need to worry if your system is not supported by an existing sensing plugin: Our API allows your devices and applications to hook into our HUMS service using standard formats such as XML and JSON. For dedicated hardware or legacy systems, we can provide you with support for interfacing with our middleware that can handle the communication with our services for you, minimising the need for changes to existing systems.</p>
