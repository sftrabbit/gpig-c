                        <p>Sense whatever data you want, from wherever you want, 24/7. With a vast array of pre-made sensing plugins for monitoring system processes, hardware in the field, or networked services, GPIC-G can bootstrap your monitoring network within minutes.</p>
                        <p>There's no need to worry if your system is not supported by an existing sensing plugin: Our API allows your devices and applications to hook into our HUMS service using standard formats such as XML and JSON. For dedicated hardware or legacy systems, we can provide you with support for interfacing with our middleware that can handle the communication with our services for you, minimising the need for changes to existing systems.</p>

                        <p>Ultra-robust enterprise-class relational databases, super-fast NoSQL datastores or anything in between, GPIG-C can offer a storage solution that will seamlessly integrate with the rest of your HUMS service.</p>
                        <p>Select from a wide range of datastores to manage your records. There's no need to pick just one either: Have different datatypes routed to different datastores to free your business from impedance mismatch. No suitable storage options? No problem! Add your own using our Storage API and stop worrying.</p>

                        <p>Every business has unique needs when it comes to data analysis and exploration. At GPIG-C, we know one size will never fit all, so that's why we offer a customisable rules engine for building your analysis platform. If you need more advanced features, our Analysis API allows you to take complete control and free your business from arbitrary constraints.</p>
                        <p>Our rules engine can be made available through a custom website on your business's intranet. Find patterns in your data, detect failures before they happen and then react, all without any user intervention.</p>

                        <p>Have reports sent to your smartphone, tablet or laptop. Have them printed out and posted to you. Have them logged and filed away. No matter what you need, our automated reporting system with built-in plugins and extensible API makes sure the right person knows what they need to know, when they need to know it. Got a meeting coming up? Hook up your Google Calendar to your account and have reports automatically generated, ready for you to discuss. Never have out of date information again.</p>

                        <p>Our notification system allows events to be pushed to the right people at the first hint of trouble. With built in alert systems such as SMS, email, push messages and more, there's almost nothing your can't do straight out of the box. Use our Notification API to create powerful feedback loops: Notify the system being monitored and allow it to react accordingly, averting a costly failure.</p>
